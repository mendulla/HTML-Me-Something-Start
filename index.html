            <h2>First Encounter with Programming</h2>
            <p>My first programming experience involved writing SPSS syntax. It was challenging yet thrilling at the same time.</p>
            <p>Prior to that I had been using SPSS by simply pointing and clicking on the front end. But now I was actually coding using SPSS syntax.</p>

            <h2>Projects and Practical Experience</h2>
            <p>Over the years, I've worked on various projects that have helped solidify my programming skills.</p>
            <p>From SPSS syntax, I moved on to STATA, SAS, R, Python and now I am learning JavaScript and C# with a nonprofit organization called LaunchCode.</p>
